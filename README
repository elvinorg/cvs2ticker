Installation
------------
Please read the INSTALL file accompanying this file.

What is cvs2ticker?
-------------------
cvs2ticker is an Elvin application designed to improve awareness between
teams of programmers or other people working together on a project stored
in a CVS repository.

NOTE: cvs2ticker requires both Elvin and CVS; for more information see below.

cvs2ticker is designed to be hooked into CVS such that it is run after each
modification to the repository, typically during `cvs commit' operations.
cvs2ticker extracts relevant information (e.g. module, modified files, and the
user-supplied comment) and sends out an Elvin notification containing this
information. The Elvin notification includes the attributes used by the
Tickertape application (see below), allowing Tickertape users to be notified
of the CVS events.

cvs2ticker is accompanied by a CGI script, cvs2web, that displays the details
of the CVS event. cvs2ticker encodes the relevant information and sends it
as arguments in an attached URL with the Elvin notification. The URL points to
the cvs2web CGI script, which decodes the information in order to display it.
cvs2web allows simple operations including viewing the latest version of the
file (obtained from the repository), viewing the differences between the latest
version and the previous version, and viewing the CVS log information. It also
provides a link to a CVSWeb (see below), providing other information and
operations. The net effect is that Tickertape users can simply select a CVS
notification and immediately view all the relevant information in their
browsers.

What is Elvin?
--------------
Elvin is a content-addressed message routing system.  It is often used
for notification of events in distributed applications, and works well
as a communications middleware.

More information about the architecture, software and applications is
available from the Elvin web page at

    http://elvin.dstc.edu.au/

What is Tickertape?
-------------------
Tickertape is an Elvin application that uses a scrolling one-line window
to provide users with a wide variety of information from many sources using a
minimum of screen space.

More information about Tickertape, and implementations on several platforms
are available from the Tickertape web page at

    http://elvin.dstc.edu.au/apps/tickertape/

What is CVS?
------------
CVS is the Concurrent Versions System, a version control system in widespread
use for software development. Although useful for individuals, the key
benefit is allowing many people in potentially widely distributed locations to
work on the same set of files concurrently.

More information about CVS, and implementations on most major platforms
are available from the CVS web page at

    http://www.cvshome.org/

What is CVSWeb?
---------------
CVSWeb is an intuitive web interface to CVS. It allows easy browsing of a CVS
repository and access to current and old versions of the files in it. It has
many nice features including colourful, side-by-side diffs between arbitrary
versions of a file.

More information about CVSWeb, as well as CVSWeb itself, is available from
the CVSWeb web page at
